The code in DIA.c does the low-level stuff of communicating with the DIA
hardware or more generally hardware that supports non-standard screen sizes.
The code has been tested with Sony OS4, Sony OS5 (portrait and landscape),
Handera (portrait), Palm OS5.2+ (portrait and landscape), Dana Alphasmart
(wide or tall).

To support DIA in your application, you need to do a couple of things.

0. Obtain the Sony SDK: http://www.jp.sonystyle.com/Clie-dev/develop_tool/index.html
   if you want to support Sony code.  Obtain the Handera SDK if you want to support
   Handera code.

1. To support Sony, compile DIA.c with -DSUPPORT_DIA_SONY.  To support Handera,
   compile DIA.c with -DSUPPORT_DIA_HANDERA.  Additionally, you must always have
   -DSUPPORT_DIA if you want any DIA support, or you can put 
      #define SUPPORT_DIA
   in a config.h file (which must in any case be available but can be empty).
   HAVE_SILKSCREEN is a synonym for SUPPORT_DIA.  Also,
   ensure that you have a sects.h file that correctly sets the code sections
   for DIA_SECTION and RESIZE_SECTION.  If your application doesn't do
   sectioning, you can just do:
      #define DIA_SECTION
      #define RESIZE_SECTION
   You also need to ensure that you have defined SafeMemPtrNew() and
   SafeMemPtrFree() code and you have prototypes for these in util.h.
   SafeMemPtrFree() should return if fed a NULL pointer, else call
   MemPtrFree(), and SafeMemPtrNew() should produce a fatal application error
   if MemPtrNew() fails.  If you don't care about error checking, you can
   always do something like:
      #define SafeMemPtrNew MemPtrNew
      #define SafeMemPtrFree( p ) if ( ( p ) != NULL ) MemPtrFree( ( p ) )

    For Palm DIA support, you need the 5r3 SDK, and all should be well: no
    need for special #defines.

2. In your application initialization (E.g., StartApplication()) code, call
   InitializeResizeSupport( indexDIADataID ) make sure this happens before the
   event handlers for your forms are set.  In your application
   de-initialization, call TerminateResizeSupport().

3. In the place in your application where you handle notifications, before
   processing any notifications, add a call to:
       Boolean HandleResizeNotification( UInt32 notificationType )
   This routine returns true if it has handled a resize notification, in
   which case you do not need to handle the notification yourself.  Note
   that the relevant notification is automatically registered for by
   InitializeResizeSupport() and that the notification type depends on
   your hardware platform.

4. Before setting the event handler for form formID, call
   SetResizePolicy( formID ).

5. In each form event handler, make sure that before doing any handling 
   yourself, you call the function:
       Boolean ResizeHandleEvent( EventType* event ) RESIZE_SECTION;
   If this function returns true, your event handler should return true;
   otherwise, you should handle the event yourself.  This applies even to
   form event handlers where you do not want any resizing.  However, you
   do not need to include resize data resources for such forms--just the
   call to ResizeHandleEvent().
   
   Earlier versions of PalmResize required calling separate handling functions
   for different event types.  This is deprecated now and may no longer work
   in the future.

5. Modify your .rcp file to include information on how to resize forms.  This
   is done by including a number of WORDLIST (wrdl) resources.  The first
   and the only non-optional one is an index resource of word pairs.
     WORDLIST ID indexDIADataID
     BEGIN
        fromID1 toID1
        fromID2 toID2
        ...
     END
   The ID indexDIADataID is the same as the one in the InitializeResizeSupport()
   call.  The list of word pairs then each contains the ID of a form resource
   followed by the ID of the WORDLIST resource that contains the DIA resize data
   for that form.  DIA is disabled for any forms not listed in the index:
   virtual graffiti is popped up and resize is disabled if possible.  It is
   perfectly acceptable to have no forms in the index or not all of them.
   Unless this conflicts with other WORDLIST IDs you might be using, it is
   easiest to use the same ID for the resize data as for the form, so
   PalmBible+'s index, for instance, starts:
       frmMain        frmMain
       frmVersionInfo frmVersionInfo
       frmMemoEdit    frmMemoEdit

6. Now include specific information on how to resize the forms in your
   application.  You should #include "resizeconsts.h" in your .rcp file to define
   various bitmapped flags.  Each set of information has the following format:
       WORDLIST ID resizeFormID
       BEGIN
          formFlags
          binNumber
          preferredState
          // Object data
          objectNum1  flags1   0
          objectNum2  flags2   0
          ...
        END

    formFlags is either 0 or a combination of:
        DIA_FORM_KEEP_LAST
        DIA_FORM_USE_BIN
        DIA_FORM_NO_RESIZE
        DIA_FORM_HANDERA
    These flags, as all flags, can be added together, e.g.:
        DIA_FORM_KEEP_LAST + DIA_FORM_USE_BIN

    DIA_FORM_KEEP_LAST:  The form keeps the DIA state that was in force
        before it was opened, unless the form uses a bin, and the bin
        has defined data.  If this flag is set, binNumber is ignored
        (but must still be included--perhaps set to zero).
    DIA_FORM_USE_BIN:  A given application can include a number of "DIA
        state bins."  All forms that use the same bin share the same DIA
        setting, and if a user resizes a form in the bin, all the other
        forms in the bin are resized.  For instance, modal dialogs might
        be put all in one bin.  Or, items which do not require graffiti
        might be put in another bin.  When an application starts up,
        unless the bin data is loaded from the application's preferences
        database, each bin entry is undefined.  The DIA_FORM_USE_BIN flag
        interacts with the DIA_FORM_KEEP_LAST flag as follows: if the bin
        has not yet been defined, the bin and the form get the DIA state
        in force when the form was opened.  Without a DIA_FORM_KEEP_LAST
        flag, the bin starts off being set to preferredState.
    Without either of these flags, whenever the form is opened, the DIA
    is set to preferredState.
    
    DIA_FORM_HANDERA:  The form is pre-measured for Handera 240x240
        screens and does not need to be re-adjusted for them.  Otherwise,
        if DIA support is linked in, the form is re-adjusted from 160x160
        to 240x240.

    preferredState is one of:
        DIA_STATE_MAX
        DIA_STATE_MIN
        DIA_STATE_NO_STATUS_BAR
    If DIA_FORM_KEEP_LAST is specified, this is ignored but must still be
    included.  The MAX and MIN refer to the size of the DIA area.  Thus,
    with DIA_STATE_MAX, the screen is typically minimized to the standard
    160x160 (or 320x320) area.  With DIA_STATE_MIN, the DIA is contracted,
    and the maximum screen size is available.  DIA_STATE_NO_STATUS_BAR is
    the same as DIA_STATE_MIN on Handera units, but on the 
    Sony NR/NX/NZ/UX/TH and Palm DIA devices it opens a full screen mode with
    no status bar.  Make sure you give the user a way of exiting this!  Sony
    recommends you do this by letting the user tap on the place where the
    status bar used to be in order to restore the status bar.

    Finally, you get a list of object resize data.  This is the part of the
    resize information that will take the most work.  By default, objects do
    not resize--they stay the same size, and the same position relative to
    the top left corner of the display.  Any objects which you want to move
    or resize with DIA changes must be listed here.  The first object (whose
    objectNum1 is ignored, but must still be included, e.g., set to 0) is 
    always the form itself, and its resizing is relative to the whole screen.  
    The other objects resize relative to the form.  At least the form itself
    must be included.

    Each object resize line starts with the object ID (ignored for the form
    itself, and set to the special value GSI_OBJECT_ID (65280) for the graffiti
    state indicator--make sure this value is not used for anything else in your
    form), then has a word specifying a combination of flags or 0 if the
    object does not need to change size or position, followed by a reserved
    word that should contain 0.  The object flags are a combination of:
       DIA_X_RATIO DIA_Y_RATIO DIA_W_RATIO DIA_H_RATIO

       DIA_X_RIGHT DIA_Y_BOTTOM

       DIA_X_PLUS_DW DIA_Y_PLUS_DH DIA_W_PLUS_DW DIA_H_PLUS_DH

       DIA_X_PLUS_1_2_DW DIA_Y_PLUS_1_2_DH DIA_W_PLUS_1_2_DW DIA_H_PLUS_1_2_DH

       DIA_X_PLUS_1_3_DW  DIA_Y_PLUS_1_3_DH  DIA_W_PLUS_1_3_DW
       DIA_H_PLUS_1_3_DH

       DIA_X_PLUS_2_3_DW  DIA_Y_PLUS_2_3_DH  DIA_W_PLUS_2_3_DW
       DIA_H_PLUS_2_3_DH

       DIA_X_PLUS_1_4_DW DIA_Y_PLUS_1_4_DH DIA_W_PLUS_1_4_DW
       DIA_H_PLUS_1_4_DH

       DIA_X_PLUS_3_4_DW  DIA_Y_PLUS_3_4_DH  DIA_W_PLUS_3_4_DW
       DIA_H_PLUS_3_4_DH

    These flags specify how the four relevant positioning values are changed.
    These values are X (horizontal coordinate), Y (vertical coordinate), W
    (width), H (height).  You can at most include one DIA_X_* flag, one DIA_Y_*
    flag, one DIA_W* and one DIA_H* flag.  If you omit a flag for one of the
    positioning values, the value is unchanged.  The positioning values have
    the following meanings:
        *_RATIO : Keep the ration of the value relative to the extent of the
                  form/display (i.e., for objects other than the form, extent
                  of the form, and for the form, extent of the display)
                  constant.  Thus, if the object was originally 37% of the
                  height of the form down in the form, then DIA_Y_RATIO will
                  try to keep the object at 37% of the height of the resized
                  form down in the form.  If the object took up half of the
                  width of the form, it will still do so if you set
                  DIA_W_RATIO.
        X_RIGHT : This ensures that the distance from the right edge of the
                  screen to the right edge of the object does not change with
                  resizing.  If the form is widened, the object moves right.
        Y_BOTTOM : This ensures that the distance from the bottom edge of the
                  screen to the bottom edge of the object does not change with
                  resizing.  If the form is lengthened, the object moves
                  down.
        *_PLUS_D[WH] : This says that the value should have added to it the
                  amount of the change in the width (DW) or height (DH) that
                  the form/display had.
        *_PLUS_*_D[WH] : This is the same as *_PLUS_D[WH] except only the
                  specified fraction of the change in the width or height is
                  added.  The fraction is one of 1_2 (1/2), 1_3 (1/3),
                  2_3 (2/3), 1_4 (1/4) or 3_4 (1/4).  Use this when you have
                  two to four objects horizontally or vertically arranged
                  which you would like to resize equally.  Make sure that
                  objects to the right or below them get the right
                  *_PLUS_*_D[WH] or X_RIGHT or Y_BOTTOM attributes.  For
                  instance, if you have two side-by-side list boxes, you might
                  do:
                    listbox1 DIA_W_PLUS_1_2_DW+DIA_H_PLUS_DH 0
                    listbox2 DIA_X_PLUS_1_2_DW+DIA_W_PLUS_1_2_DW+DIA_H_PLUS_DH 0
                  This way, listbox1 and listbox2 each get the full benefit of
                  any form lengthening (DIA_H_PLUS_DH), and each get half of the
                  benefit of the form widening (DIA_W_PLUS_1_2_DW).  Moreover,
                  we made sure that listbox2 would be placed further to the right
                  to compensate for listbox1 widening, as needed.
    Additionally, there is a DIA_H_GRANULAR attribute which forces the height for
    a list or field to be an integral number of rows, unless this would force
    the height to be zero.

7. Unfortunately, currently (as of pilrc 3.2 beta 1), pilrc does not support
   arithmetic in WORDLIST resources.  This is a serious problem for adding up
   flags.  The recommended solution is the following.  Run the .rcp file
   through cpp, after first changing final \ to @backslash@ with sed (otherwise
   multiline strings are mangled;  if there aren't any such, nevermind).  Then 
   run the resulting file through the doaddition.pl perl script which (a) does 
   the arithmetic inside WORDLIST resources and changes each final @backslash@ 
   back to \.  doaddition.pl is not very smart.  Make sure that WORDLIST is all 
   caps and that WORDLIST, BEGIN and END are all flush on the left margin in 
   the .rcp file.  The following should do the trick:
	   sed 's/\\$$/@backslash@/' < file.rcp | cpp | perl doaddition.pl > file.rcp.out
   Then run pilrc on file.rcp.out.

8. If you have the Sony status bar hidden, Sony recommends that you allow the
   user to restore the area via a tap in that hidden area.  To this end, you
   can use 
       void GetHiddenStatusBarArea( RectangleType* area )
   to get the area covered by the status bar (in current coordinates under OS5,
   and in standard coordinates otherwise).  If the status bar is showing, an empty 
   rectangle is returned.

9. Finally, you can call
       void ResizeRefreshCurrentForm( void );
   to refresh the current form's DIA settings and redraw the form.  Normally
   there should be no need to call this if you've followed the above
   instructions.  A need to call this suggests a bug in resize.c or in your
   code.  But this may be a temporary work-around until the bug is fixed.

10. For Handera support, your .rcp file should contain:
    HEX "sKst" ID 1000
        0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
    You also need the Handera SDK.  It's no longer available from the Handera
    website.  You can get it from the non-free directory of the source distribution
    of the latest PalmBible+ release: palmbibleplus.sf.net .  Moreover, to avoid
    using 2/3 size fonts, you should replace all calls FntSetFont( f ) with calls
    FntSetFont( HanderaAdjustFont( f ) ).  You can also use HanderaCoord( x ) to
    convert from standard 160x160 coordinates to 240x240.  Both functions just 
    return their argument unchanged not on a Handera system.

11. For Dana AlphaSmart support, your .rcp file should contain:
    HEX "wTap" ID 1000
        0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01

12. You can save and restore the user's DIA bin settings to prefs, so that each bin
    keeps the same state between sessions.  To restore settings, right after
    calling InitializeResizeSupport(), call
            extern void LoadResizePrefs( UInt32 appID, UInt16 prefID ) RESIZE_SECTION;
    with your apps appID and with a prefID you aren't using as a preference ID for
    anything else.  To save settings, right before calling TerminateResizeSupport(),
    call:
            extern void SaveResizePrefs( UInt32 appID, UInt16 prefID, Int16 version )
                RESIZE_SECTION;
    The arguments have the same meaning, except you need to specify a version number
    for your pref.  You can just put 0 each time if you want.

13. If you need to make additional modifications to your form after a resize, these
    modifications should be made in a handler for winDisplayChangedEvent.  Note that
    after a ResizeSupportInitialize() call, this event is emitted on all supported
    hardware when the silk/DIA area resizes or when the screen orientation changes,
    so you don't have to worry about the fact that, say, normally Sony OS4 units
    don't emit it.  If you opt to use the deprecated method of calling
          ResizeHandleWinDisplayChangedEvent()
    from the handler instead of calling ResizeHandleEvent(), you should make custom
    modifications after ResizeHandleWinDisplayChangedEvent() is done.  Note that you
    can reliably count on a frmUpdateFormEvent happening (with updateCode ==
    redrawUpdateCode) at some point soon after the winDisplayChangedEvent handler
    gets done, so you do not need to enqueue a frmUpdateFormEvent yourself.  You
    can also do all your changes from within a frmUpdateFormEvent handler.
    
    Such additional changes need to be made, for instance, for tables.  While 
    palmResize will resize the outside dimensions, you need to decide whether to
    resize the cells, insert more cells, or whatever.

14. A demo of how to run palmResize is in the demo directory.  You may need to edit
    the Makefile to get it to compile.
